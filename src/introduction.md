<h1 align="center">Notice</h1>

> This is a sad notice that our Internet Hero (@TheBinitGhimire) had recent demise on 26th of June, 2022. Since has has passed away, and I was the one who implemented online repo system in collaboration with [Penterter-Nepal](https://github.com/Pentester-Nepal) using [this](https://git.io/signatures_json) as repo and there was an issue for using local/custom `signatures.json` file and not from the repo. Hence, I've implemented it with a major release version (everying is almost same except for naming since we need to make releases) and few misc changes.

<h1 align="center"> NtH1M - Super Fast Sub-domain Takeover Detection </h1>

**NtH1M** (Now, the Host 1s Mine!) is a command-line utility built with Rust, which enables security enthusiasts to discover subdomain takeover vulnerabilities in hostnames (domains and subdomains) from different organizations.

- Huge list of vulnerable platform signatures,
- Built with Rust for memory safety, speed and efficiency,
- Ability to scan a single target or a file containing a list of targets,
- Extremely fast scanning,
- Built-in concurrency,
- Timeout on connections,
- Super lightweight binaries,
- Verbosity for in-depth scan information,
- Release binaries for many different platforms and architectures,
- Ability to export scan results to a file.
- **Ability to use custom fingerprint.json/signatures.json file!**

This guide consists of documentations for users and developers using or contributing to NtH1M.

## Workflow

### Platform Identification
**NtH1M** uses the data provided in **[EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz)** for the platform identification.
