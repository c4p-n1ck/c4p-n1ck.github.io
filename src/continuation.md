# Continuation

After since the demise of the original author of the tool, I decided to keep this project alive with most requested feature being given to the user of the tool.

But, why did I decide to do so? It's because I'd contributed something cool and core to this project and that was using an [online repo](https://git.io/signatures_json) for subdomain signatures by requesting to an Admin of [@Pentester-Nepal](https://github.com/Pentester-Nepal) ([#TheNittam](https://github.com/TheNittam)) for using an online git repository for subdomain takeover signatures. And, all thanks to him that he agreed and we have it!

But then people started requesting to make use of custom `signatures.json` / `platforms.json` file which I've added it with this tool!

And, until I find a maintainer for this project I've decided to maintain it myself.
